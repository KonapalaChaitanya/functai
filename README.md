## üåü Core Concepts

### 2.1 The `@ai` Decorator

This is a special tool in FunctAI that makes your function smarter. You simply attach the `@ai` statement on top of your function. This allows FunctAI to understand the process better.

### 2.2 The `_ai` Sentinel

The `_ai` sentinel acts as a guide within your functions. It helps you monitor how your AI behaves and makes improvements when necessary. Work with this sentinel to fine-tune your function outputs.

### 2.3 Post-processing and Validation

Once your function runs, you may want to check the results. FunctAI offers easy options for validating outputs. You can filter incorrect results and refine your functions to suit your needs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Structured Output and Type System

### 3.1 Basic Types

FunctAI supports basic data types, like strings and integers. Understanding these types can help you organize your functions better. For instance, using strings for names and integers for ages keeps everything clear.

### 3.2 Dataclasses and Complex Structures

You can create more complex functions by using dataclasses. These allow you to combine various data types into one structured format. This can be especially helpful when dealing with multiple inputs.

### 3.3 Restricted Choices

FunctAI lets you restrict inputs through choice fields. This method helps prevent errors and ensures that the function receives valid information. 

## üîß Configuration and Flexibility

### 4.1 Custom Settings

FunctAI offers options to customize your experience. You can adjust the interface layout, notification settings, or even change the theme to suit your style.

### 4.2 Integration Options

If you want to expand your usage, FunctAI integrates easily with other applications. You can send outputs directly to your preferred software or systems.
